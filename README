DESCRIPTION
-----------
Aftermath is an effort to produce an deep and engaging strategy game set from
the early 18th to the early 20th century. Our goal is to provide a unique
balance of deep thought, comprehensive detail, and historical accuracy that
adds up to an enjoyable grand strategy experience.

Clearly, we've got our work cut out for us! If you want to discuss the
project, join our freenode channel at #aftermath.

DEPENDENCIES
------------
Aftermath requires the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and the C++ bindings for libconfig (libconfig++).
